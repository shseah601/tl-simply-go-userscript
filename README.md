# Script for TL SimplyGo Web Page

Since SimplyGo mobile application or website are not able to calculate the total amount of monthly transactions. I decided to create this script to calculate for me. The script added extra functionality to TL SimplyGo Web.

## Main Function

  1. Calculate `MY STATEMENTS` Total Amount.
  2. Year and Month selection for monthly statement.
