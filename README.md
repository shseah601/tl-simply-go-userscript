# Script for TL SimplyGo Web Page

Since SimplyGo mobile application or website are not able to calculate the total amount of monthly transactions. I decided to create this tampermonkey script to calculate for me. The script added extra functionality to TL SimplyGo Web.

## Main Function

  1. Calculate `MY STATEMENTS` Total Amount and Posted Amount.
  2. Year and Month selection for monthly statement.

## Tampermonkey Guide

Watch [Tampermonkey official guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tyjJD65zws)

After installed Tampermonkey, go to [tl-simply-go.user.js](https://github.com/shseah601/tl-simply-go-userscript/blob/main/tl-simply-go.user.js) and click `Raw` to view script in raw mode. Tampermonkey will read the raw script and prompt to install script.

Then it will show the screen as screenshot.
